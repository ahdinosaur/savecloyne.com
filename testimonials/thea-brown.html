<p>College. When I got to college I was a lost little freshman swept up in the mesmerizing waves of new faces and forms. It blurred together in my mind as an impenetrable force that would merely guide me along from Wheeler to Dwinelle as I tried to remain afloat with weak notions of my identity and my existence. Day after day was a meal spent eating alone with a book trying hard to look like this fate was my own choice but not a product of being completely overwhelmed by my inability to process the loss of security I had built up in my own private suburban state of mind. No familiar faces. No familiar places. A new independence that left me feeling weak and alone. My mental state constantly tiptoeing on the brink of an utter breakdown, and this is all without the consideration of my UC Berkeley school load.</p>
<p>Then I found the BSC. When I first started boarding at Kingman Hall my freshman year, things started to change. There was a promise that community and family was possible. There was a promise that I could belong to someone and something once again. Being a boarder at a co-op however, is not the same as being a member in the community. It takes a lot more effort on the part of the border to put acclimate and understand the house culture. Or at least for me it did. I lived on the other side of campus in a constant state of feeling as though I was not actually fully apart of the community. Dinners were nightmares if the one or two individuals I had become close with were not present. It was hard, but it was better. It gave me so much hope for when it was finally my turn to move into a house.</p>
<p> In fall of 2012 I moved into Stebbins Hall. I lived at Stebbins Hall for three semesters and a summer. I was Social Manager for the entire year of 2013.  In some ways Stebbins was everything that I had ever wanted out of a house and a community. We traveled together as one big entity of family and laughter throughout my time there. I had never felt more loved in my entire life. However, during my time at Stebbins I dealt with the suicides of two of my house members as well as a very serious issue with a third. At these times I was 19 and 20 years old. The management staff of my house had a median age of 21. In short, we were a group of kids trying to deal with an extremely obvious mental health issue on our own. From the BSC we received a counselor that visited the house the week after the occurrences. We were then referred to outside resources. This was the response to both of the suicides. </p>
<p>After Cody Johnson passed in the fall of 2012, I took on the role of social manager. A constant question in my head was how to create an environment that was inclusive of the whole house to foster a community in which an issue with mental health would be more apparent to the house at large rather than hidden behind closed doors. I received no training on how to do this at Social Manager training. I tried so hard all semester to accomplish this feeling as though it was my duty as the Social Manager to create the house culture while I had no formal training actual to do so. I was pulling out of thin air, of Googled party theme suggestions, of Yahoo Answers “Free Things to Do in the Bay Area.”</p>
<p>Then the second incident occurred at Stebbins over the summer of 2013. Summer was an odd time at Stebbins because everything was in such flux and transition between the two sessions. There were numerous international students who I never even met despite the fact that I was in a manager position. There was an air of unfamiliarity and uncertainty within the house at all times, but it was still the house that I had grown to love over the past two years. I felt like I had moved so far from the pain and hurt of the fall semester, so I could never imagine being placed back in that place once again. Then one night I got a call from a friend at Davis saying that he feared that one of my housemates was at risk at harming herself. It was a girl I barely knew but had known for a long time. Someone I never even imagined would be in this position. The manager team searched for what felt like hours for her. When we finally found her I held her in my arms until the ambulance arrived. The management team decided that this was a situation to keep private from the rest of the house out of concern for the privacy and confidentiality of the girl. We weren’t instructed as to what to do in this sort of situation. Two nights later I held Wine &amp; Cheese for the house. Towards the end of the event I broke down in front of the entire house. I wasn’t instructed on what to do in a situation like this at Social Manager training.</p>
<p>Summer ending and fall began. My CoSocial Manager for Fall 2013 was my best friend in the entire world. I had never been more excited for a semester in my entire life. We had a very ambitious, but manageable calendar planned for the entire semester. Our goal was to hold an event each week that served as some sort of community building activity. Only 22 Stebbinites remained in the house from the previous semesters and with a community of 43 new Stebbinites we wanted to figure out how to establish the loving-family house culture that had existed in prior semesters.</p>
<p>I look back at the events of what occurred in the that semester with so much sadness and so much regret. Maliq had just begun to establish himself within our house as a voice to be heard. He was the kind of person that came to council and stayed till the very end, giving any sort of thought or opinion he had along the way. I would study with Maliq almost every night in the Mystery Room, his strange quirky jokes breaking the monotony of my readings. I can’t stress this enough, but I feel so much regret over what happened. There were warning signs from the beginning. At one of the first house check-ins we held during the semester he discussed his battles with depression. None of us knew what to do to help other than thank him for sharing. We’re trained in conflict resolution, but not licensed professionals. </p>
<p>A couple weeks later there was an incident that occurred that deeply troubled several individuals. I honestly don’t remember what our house manager decided to do in response to the incident and do not blame anyone for what actions were or weren’t taken. All I know was just under a week later Maliq was gone. I got the call while I was out shopping for the final Room-to-Room supplies at CVS for that night. I remember walking through the rain back to the car. I didn’t know who to call or what to say. I knew I had to tell the house about the party at the very least, but that seemed so superficial. So inconsequential. Above all I just couldn’t understand why this was happening again. </p>
<p>I called my parents first. They couldn’t understand how this could have happened again. They couldn’t understand why once again I was being put through this. They couldn’t understand why some sort of increase in mental health awareness and safety hadn&#39;t already been implemented within the BSC in order to prevent this from happening. They wanted me to move out immediately. I tried to reason with them. When I lived without the BSC I was utterly alone in such a huge and scary place. I didn’t know what to do. The BSC gave me family and community. It gave me safety and security. My parents said that while it was true that the BSC gave me family and community it was obvious that it was not providing me with safety. The BSC is a housing organization, my parents said. They are not your family.</p>
<p>After Maliq’s passing I became increasingly involved at Cloyne as Maliq had been a more involved member for longer within that community. At Cloyne I began to feel the same sense of community that I had felt at Stebbins before. Except at Cloyne it was a little bit different. Cloyne has around 18 manager positions within the house extending from Viceroy to Kitchen to Safe Space to Bathroom. The level of accountability within the house was incredible to witness. Another incredible aspect of Cloyne was the position of the Facilities Manager. Graham helped us with so many of the technical aspects of Maliq’s passing that in the previous semester had all been placed upon the responsibility of our House Manager, Torey Kocsik. I felt the sense that for once it wasn&#39;t solely the responsibility of a bunch of 20-year-old students to deal with and move on from a problem as tragic as this. I continued going to check-ins and meetings at Cloyne after this event. I had private meetings with the Safe Space Manager. Moving on from this event I felt like my mental health was being more cared for than ever before. But it was not by any program that had been installed by the BSC, but rather within the community at Cloyne.</p>
<p>I made the decision to move to Cloyne for my Spring Semester. For this semester. It was a hard choice for me to make as leaving Stebbins meant the conclusion to a huge chapter of my life. But I had witnessed too much tragedy and the space had been transformed as a result of it before my eyes. Cloyne was to be a fresh start. Cloyne was to be my final resting place for the rest of the duration of my college career. Cloyne was the community that had helped me understand tragedy when no one else seemed to be able to.</p>
<p>I understand the tough legal situation that the BSC has been cornered into as the result of the actions of John Gibson in 2010 and the previous “culture of destruction” that existed at Cloyne. I did not move to Cloyne because of the “culture of destruction.” I moved to Cloyne because at a time when I was in need the community opened up their house and arms to accept me and try to help me working through what I still won’t be able to understand. What I hope the BSC, cabinet, board, or whoever it is actually making this decision can understand is that by forcibly removing me from this community that has done so much for me… I just don’t understand it. I haven’t done anything wrong. My housemates haven’t done anything wrong. I understand that sometimes bad things happen to good people for no reason… But I just can’t even begin to understand why such a drastic approach is being taken for this issue.</p>
<p>I urge you all to consider the counterproposal that will be presented by Cloyne. I don’t care if our house has parties or maintains the Cloyne rumor “image” that has be propagated these past years. What I care about is I get to remain in the community that I have begun to felt safe and cared for in. What I care about is the BSC doing something to not only prevent substance abuse within Cloyne, but substance abuse within the ENTIRE BSC. Along with that I BEG the BSC to work on a plan for the entire BSC to have an increased mental health resources. I understand that at the most basic level the BSC is a housing organization and I understand the rhetoric in the mission statement of the BSC really drives in that message, but I also believe that an intrical part of the BSC community is that it is just that. A community. It is why the BSC provides managers with training workshops. It is why managers are required to run certain workshops. It is why I fell in love with the BSC. If more efforts were made to protect our mental health… I mean… Doesn’t Central Office care about us more than on a landlord tenant basis? Isn’t that why I moved here?</p>
<p>I’m going into my senior year. I am writing an honors thesis. My studies and internship are about to become the most important things in my life right now. I do not need to deal with feeling unsafe, uncertain, and unsure in a community I am unfamiliar with again. I’m asking you to please hear us out and work with us to find a solution that does not evict me from my home for nothing that I did. A solution that is comprehensive enough so that when questions are asked for it, the BSC President and VP of Internal Affairs can actually answer them.</p>
<p>I’m sorry this email has been long. I have had a lot on my mind and I felt that the only way I could get back to the two essays that I have due on Thursday without crying, that I haven’t even begun to deal with because I have been working on a plan to not be evicted from my house since that February 13th, was to send out what was on my mind. I know maybe this won’t even matter or affect anything. I’d like to think a single voice can make a difference but time and time again that sentiment is proven wrong.</p>
