<p>During my senior year at Cal, I was fortunate enough to find myself among clones and even had the honor of serving as a house manager. And I can say with the utmost sincerity that my short time at Cloyne has fostered more personal growth than all my earlier years at Cal combined. Cloyne is an anomaly in a college community in that students from different backgrounds and with various academic and personal interests come together to live as a family. It is a safe haven for the quirky to freely express themselves and for the more serious (like myself) to rediscover what they know about human interaction.</p>
<p>Even though I have left Cloyne, Cloyne has not left me. The interpersonal skills that I developed from interacting with the unique and creative souls I met at Cloyne have allowed me to better connect and empathize with patients that I see at medical school.  And I have no doubt that my experience at Cloyne will continue to be a valuable tool in my training to become a physician.</p>
<p>Is Cloyne a utopia? Of course not! When you gather 150 college students under one roof, mistakes happen – some more unfortunate than others. It is easy to point out the problems in Cloyne’s history. It is always easier to criticize. But I hope that those few faults of past does not overshadow the wonderful memories and life-changing experiences that were created at Cloyne.</p>
