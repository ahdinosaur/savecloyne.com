<p>I was in Cloyne for two years and living there fundamentally changed my perspective of… pretty much everything. It’s no exaggeration to say that there is nowhere else in the world quite like it. I had the pleasure of being a part of the most radically diverse community that I have yet seen, and it troubles me to imagine a future without this dense haven of compassion, love, acceptance, and expression.</p>
<p>I find myself not infrequently referring back to my days at Cloyne Court. The succulent afternoons sharing a swinging bench with 5 others, eating a tacky stirfry generously graced with Sriracha, Tapatio, ketchup, or some combination of the three. Blasting Jimi Hendrix, Sublime, or some unidentifiable electronic music at 9 pm in the kitchen so that pot washing resembles a dance rather than a workshift. Not giving a fuck or two worries about acting silly because in this house, there is no such thing. Lunatic is an embraced word here. And what about the walls? Isn’t it the most beautiful thing? Think about all the different ideas and personalities splashed onto the Cloyne canvas throughout the decades. I myself took part in history and added my own piece to the collage. Every stroll down the hallways elicits a different story.</p>
<p>I left Cloyne over a year ago and am in medical school now in Chicago. It’s true, the cliché that you don’t truly appreciate what you had until its out of reach. At Cloyne, I could be whoever, experiment with different character manifestations of myself, and get away with it. Here lies the value of Cloyne, it is a safe place for play. To take part, I had to learn to see the beauty that lies in human interaction and shared experiences. This isn’t easy and difficult to teach in other settings. I have carried this outlook with me since, along with a fistful of other wisdoms that my fellow pirates have imparted upon me. We should cherish the environment and eclectic culture that this hotel of 150 students magically radiates.</p>
<p>Cloyne is an anchor for me, and I always look back to my time there wishing that the rest of the world were a bit more like Cloyne. Or I think, “Cloyne Is Suck,” and am infinitely happier knowing that I had the fortune of being a clone.</p>
