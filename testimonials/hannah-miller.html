<p>Cloyne is a lot.  Cloyne is so much, it&#39;s too much to put in a single testimonial, or even the testimonials of all current and past students.  How can something be both a place, a community, and a way of life?  Well, I present to you: the entirety of the experience that is Cloyne Court. I fell in love at Cloyne.  I learned how to cook at Cloyne.  I discovered the importance and methodology of dishwashing at Cloyne.  I got to wear a ghostbusters backpack vacuum at Cloyne. I both found a voice and found the values of being quiet. I danced and sang and ate and laughed---repeat. I grew to respect and revere the traditions passed down from old Clones when I first moved here, and have loved each semester getting to pass down to a new generation the stories and more beautiful elements of house culture as a manager and now old clone.  Our time here is short.  What is special is the continuity of the sense of community that this house is steeped in.  Within a matter of years, the house will be a completely different composition, but the inheritance of our memories is what keeps it strong.</p>
<p>A huge part of what this house and cooperative community teaches you is that if you see something wrong, take the initiative to try and fix it.  Each time I saw something I wanted to improve or change, Cloyne has provided me with the space and materials to &quot;be the change&quot; I wanted to see in my world.  We provide resources for workshops, clubs, events, outreach, music, and if any individual in the community has something they wish to see as part of our house, they have equal right and voice to present it to the house.  That to me is one of the fundamental aspects of cooperation and the cooperative movement.</p>
<p>Another, is the value and diversity of different types of learning.  In this house, everyone has something to learn, and something to teach.  Cloyne helps facilitate a forum where all kinds of knowledge are passed from individuals to the community at whole, and as a result, the entire community is left a better place.  Cloyne is suck.</p>
