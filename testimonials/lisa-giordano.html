<p>I began spending time at Cloyne during my sophomore year, and from the moment I walked through the creaky wooden door into the multicolored hallways, onto the sweet/ stale carpets, and through the graffitied doorways, I felt something stronger than I’d ever felt at Berkeley before. A sense of connection, of wonder, of excitement, of ambiguity all through me. I felt drawn to the building, its vast open dining room with its long tables, the swings in the courtyard littered with mason jars and half empty bottles of Siracha and empty bottles of wine, the music from the kitchen, the yoga mats in the courtyard, the panda in the palm tree…But mostly, I felt drawn to the people. Each person a caricature of themselves. Each person with a style that communicated their beautiful, eccentric interior, moving passionately throughout the house with a distinct presence—I remember being amazed at how much people could bring a space to life, I remember thinking that Cloyne really was a “living space”. I was inspired by every person I interacted with, learning something new from each conversation I had. In my mind always the distinct thought: “this is it”. I knew immediately that this is where my home would be for the remainder of my college experience.</p>
<p>But never did I expect the immense, positive growth I would experience through living here. Cloyne presents a space for the individual to flourish. Cloyne inspires each person to really delve deep and find what he or she (or ze) is passionate about, and truly decide what kind of individual he/she/ze would be proud to be. And mostly, Cloyne provides the FREEDOM to cultivate and develop that individual. I have always seen Cloyne as somewhat of a “hole” in society that represents a place of unfettered liberation from the status quo and usual expectations. Paint the walls, dance around naked, paint henna on your boobs, do acro-yoga on the grass, bake zucchini bread, learn how to hack, voice your politics, spray-paint your clothes, smoke your cigarettes, paint glitter on your face, experiment with your sexuality, drink champagne in the sun, decide to build a boat-deck and receive unquestioning approval from the entire house.  This pervasive feeling of freedom contained within these walls sparks transformation in every person that lives here. To be a Clone is to truly know yourself.</p>
<p>I look back on the ways in which I’ve grown through this house, and I am overwhelmed. I’ve learned to define my self-worth apart from the approval of others, to be proud of my intellect, to fight for what I believe in, not to be embarrassed by my eccentricities, to celebrate my capabilities, to admit my weaknesses, to take action when necessary, and to step back let others take charge when appropriate. I’ve learned to appreciate others for their whole selves, and to understand a variety of perspectives so different from my own. I SINCERELY hope that Cloyne will be able to maintain is culture and its freedom, and I hope it will remain a space to unite, to inspire, to grow, and to experience life in its purest, most unfettered form.</p>
