<p>From the moment I joined Cloyne upon first arriving at Cal, it has served as an incredible mentor in my life and academic endeavors not just for myself, but for the friends I got to meet there as well.
Thanks to Cloyne Court’s encouragement, I got to further develop my public speaking skills by preparing and facilitating Community Action Workshops (CAWs) on behalf of the Berkeley Student Cooperative (BSC), two of which centered on the neuroscience of substance use and prevention. While living there, I also successfully passed certification exams for running the 3T MRI ($3M machine) at the UC Berkeley Brain Imaging Center, was awarded biomedical research and academic fellowships by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, had 3 first-author scientific poster presentations at international conferences, submitted a first-author manuscript to a peer-reviewed journal, and accomplished much more under its care and guidance than I probably would have without its inspiration and support. Lastly, during my last semester there (SP ’13), I was awarded a prestigious pre-doctoral research fellowship from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA).</p>
<p>Its passion for free speech and discovery is easily noticed, and its strong work ethic makes it a strong asset within the Berkeley community. Cloyne Court is truly full of leaders and active, dynamic scholars. It is also a dedicated and creative institution whose awareness of the world around it moves other organizations to look more deeply, too. For the time I was at Cloyne, it has always housed students that care for one another and who take time out of their own work to help others.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I am confident that Cloyne Court will continue to make significant contributions to the creative performing arts, academia, and progress in general. However, its existence as it stands now is in danger and it is my hope with this note that its current values, autonomy and positive and creative environment for those that need it are not compromised by the current proposal by the BSC Board of Directors.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
