<p>I, Nicole Shanae Steward, can&#39;t remember how long I&#39;ve lived in Cloyne. Sure if I count down the semesters and the things that happened to back when I remember moving in, I could figure it out, but that doesn&#39;t matter. What matters is that no matter how long I&#39;ve lived here, Cloyne has never been anything but a warm, welcoming, nurturing, fun, creative, and diverse home.</p>
<p>I started out in the dorms like most freshman, and hated it. They were too clean, without character, and through their attempts at fostering floor and dormwide community I felt more isolated than ever. The heterogeneity of a dorm culture was stifling. I only got 5 free counseling sessions at the tang, and when those ran out, I held onto my sanity  by a thread. I visited the frats very often, finding myself in unfamiliar places more often than not. I couldn&#39;t even find much comfort in the company of people of my own color through student of color run organizations and themed housing. I thought about quitting, dropping out, changing schools, dying. And I thought about those for so long.</p>
<p>But sometime in my second semester a guy in a neighboring dorm dragged me to Cloyne to meet a friend of his. It was a band night, and though I knew no one I stayed until the very end, despite my friend leaving not very long after we arrived. Before I&#39;d spoken to anyone I was welcome into the energy of the house by the smiling faces posted to security at the door. I left that night, leaving part of my soul and mind behind, but came back as soon as I&#39;d heard about another party. Again, I remember, I&#39;d spoken to no one from the house besides the security of band night ( I didn&#39;t even really meet my friend&#39;s friend), but I felt more comfort and belonging than I had felt since before being uprooted to California from my home in Oklahoma.</p>
<p>I decided that after that I was going to live in Cloyne, and I waited for a year. I was able to live there for half a summer, and then ( due to my low points in the BSC) was moved to another co-op, but I paid for boarding at Cloyne to make sure that I would get in and be able to stay there for the rest of my college career.</p>
<p>No place has inspired me more than this beautiful home, and sharing this amazing house, and its history, and its love with the hundreds to thousands of people that I&#39;ve seen is more than I could have ever asked for out of any place of residence, or out of any landlord.</p>
<p>I swore to myself that one day, I would add my art to the walls of Cloyne like my peers and my elders before me, and it saddens me to know that if we&#39;re so drastically affected by the response to the accident four years ago, that not only will I never be able to return to the only place in Berkeley where I have felt completely safe and accepted, but that others after me will never get to experience a community where all members love, care, and watch out for each other.</p>
<p>I help manage Cloyne&#39;s kitchen now, and hold another part-time job as well, and attend UC Berkeley as a full time student, and I hold a B average GPA. Since I moved into Cloyne my grades, mental stability, and outlook on life and people has improved by leaps and bounds, and I don&#39;t have myself or Tang Center psychiatrists to thank.</p>
<p>Cloyne is not its history, Cloyne is not dangerous.</p>
<p>Cloyne is a huge house, with great people where opportunities are endless.</p>
