Ask anyone who has ever walked in the front door of Cloyne Court Hotel & Casino and they'll tell you that there isn't another place in the world quite like it. Yes, it's a student cooperative, one of seventeen in the BSC, but it's not just that. Cloyne stands apart due to a unique house culture that's hard to relay to outsiders.

Walking down the hall lined with murals of Where the Wild Things Are and Ferdinand the Bull, you'll pass the LibEd room, where any night in the week you're bound to find someone playing 18th century classical music on a recently tuned piano, an aerial yoga instruction, guided meditation, or a discussion on food justice. The strength of Cloyne is in its numbers. As anyone who's ever been to a Cloyne dinner knows, the range of human experience inside those walls is almost as large as their collective appetite. 

While living there, every night over dinner, I could talk to a different person who was fast becoming an expert on neurobiology, conservational forestry, religious studies, art, design, film, literature, psychology, or many other subjects. Like some metropolitan city with many vibrant neighborhoods, Cloyne has within it countless micro-cultures that co-exist in a remarkable way. 

Growing up playing in bands, I was drawn to Cloyne because it has a band room. Cloyne is the only place in Berkeley I knew that would tolerate me playing loud music with friends at pretty much any hour that we could meet up. I recorded part of my most recent album in Cloyne, as I know the awesome band Waterstrider has done as well. For home improvement, as a way to show how grateful I was for the space, I oversaw a project to better soundproof the band room. 

Musicians like Elliot Smith, No Doubt, Devo, and more recently Meat Market, Rilo Kiley, and FIDLAR, found in Cloyne a welcome place to play shows while touring the West Coast. I worry that the newly proposed out-of-house party restrictions will be the end to a rich musical legacy I was lucky to have witnessed. 

I find the fact that Cloyne is to be re-labelled as an "academically themed" house insulting, as it implies some drastic change from the current house mentality. The individual "Clones" that I have met and lived with have consistently amazed me with their ability to juggle academic achievements, creative projects, community outreach, and personal relationships. For many people, Cloyne is a place to explore, experiment, scream at the top of your lungs, and really figure things out in a nonjudgemental environment. It was here that I learned I was responsible for myself. 

A vote to purge Cloyne of every current member is essentially destroying what countless generations of Clones have worked so hard as a community to make: a bizarre, and beautiful family of one hundred and fifty. In doing so you are killing a rare animal, both the first and last of its kind, and the world will be a worse place without it.
