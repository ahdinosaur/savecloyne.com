We are a house of 150 strong, loving, passionate, corky, beautiful people. Cloyne has given us not only a home, but a moment in time where we can embrace exactly who we are and be loved for that. Our eccentricities are not looked down upon but rather, greatly appreciated. I have learned how to love, to lead, to forgive, to challenge myself, and more. I don't want anyone to be deprived of such a powerful, life affirming experience. I love this house, and everyone who I have had the pleasure to meet, even if ever so briefly.

CLOYNE IS SUCK,

May her beauty live on to inspire legions of future clones.
