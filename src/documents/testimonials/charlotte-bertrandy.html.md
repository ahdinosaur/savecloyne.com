I lived in Cloyne in 2011-2012, during the year I spent at Cal as an exchange student. It has been several years I left California, but no matter how far away I am now, I will always remember this very special place at 2600, Ridge road.

I could talk about all the memories I have there – all the precious friends I made, all the laughs and thought-provoking, inspiring and challenging conversations I can recall. I could mention the beautiful murals I would admire every time I'd stumbled upon them, the creativity of each member in decorating the house for the special events that were hold, their enthusiasm for sharing, learning about the world and welcoming anyone who wanted to be part of the house. But beyond these personal memories, I would like to stress the importance of showing respect towards a community of people.

What made the 'Cloyne spirit' , all the stories and traditions shouldn't get lost – out of respect for all those who brought something to it and built it together over the years. Cloyne is more than a house, it's a community of people that all contributed to create an atmosphere that made so many feel welcome, comfortable and, most importantly, home. Let's respect all the efforts and the years spent building this spirit. Let's give Cloyne and all the generations of Clones who lived there the respect they deserve; putting an end to the story and the memories of this place would be an unnecessary, cruel and absurd decision.
