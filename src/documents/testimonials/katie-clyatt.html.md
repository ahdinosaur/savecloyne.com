Cloyne is a haven, a safety harbor in a chaotic city and extremely competitive University. Out there, people are rushing, raving, ranting, but once you swing open the doors of Cloyne you have entered a secret garden, where everything is possible and nothing is not. Cloyne is a place to release negative energy accumulated from a stressful day by swinging your body to beats in the kitchen, pouring passion into cooking a meal for 60 housemates, or laying to rest in the sunny courtyard. Cloyne is finally finding the courage to stand up in front of 100 people and play your first performance on the guitar. Cloyne is a blank wall, an open slate waiting for you to spread vibrant colors across its surface, and ultimately, your life. Cloyne stays with you, whether your leaving for class or leaving for good, Cloyne stays with you everywhere you go.
