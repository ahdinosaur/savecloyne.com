I, Nicole Shanae Steward, can't remember how long I've lived in Cloyne. Sure if I count down the semesters and the things that happened to back when I remember moving in, I could figure it out, but that doesn't matter. What matters is that no matter how long I've lived here, Cloyne has never been anything but a warm, welcoming, nurturing, fun, creative, and diverse home.

I started out in the dorms like most freshman, and hated it. They were too clean, without character, and through their attempts at fostering floor and dormwide community I felt more isolated than ever. The heterogeneity of a dorm culture was stifling. I only got 5 free counseling sessions at the tang, and when those ran out, I held onto my sanity  by a thread. I visited the frats very often, finding myself in unfamiliar places more often than not. I couldn't even find much comfort in the company of people of my own color through student of color run organizations and themed housing. I thought about quitting, dropping out, changing schools, dying. And I thought about those for so long.

But sometime in my second semester a guy in a neighboring dorm dragged me to Cloyne to meet a friend of his. It was a band night, and though I knew no one I stayed until the very end, despite my friend leaving not very long after we arrived. Before I'd spoken to anyone I was welcome into the energy of the house by the smiling faces posted to security at the door. I left that night, leaving part of my soul and mind behind, but came back as soon as I'd heard about another party. Again, I remember, I'd spoken to no one from the house besides the security of band night ( I didn't even really meet my friend's friend), but I felt more comfort and belonging than I had felt since before being uprooted to California from my home in Oklahoma.

I decided that after that I was going to live in Cloyne, and I waited for a year. I was able to live there for half a summer, and then ( due to my low points in the BSC) was moved to another co-op, but I paid for boarding at Cloyne to make sure that I would get in and be able to stay there for the rest of my college career.

No place has inspired me more than this beautiful home, and sharing this amazing house, and its history, and its love with the hundreds to thousands of people that I've seen is more than I could have ever asked for out of any place of residence, or out of any landlord.

I swore to myself that one day, I would add my art to the walls of Cloyne like my peers and my elders before me, and it saddens me to know that if we're so drastically affected by the response to the accident four years ago, that not only will I never be able to return to the only place in Berkeley where I have felt completely safe and accepted, but that others after me will never get to experience a community where all members love, care, and watch out for each other.

I help manage Cloyne's kitchen now, and hold another part-time job as well, and attend UC Berkeley as a full time student, and I hold a B average GPA. Since I moved into Cloyne my grades, mental stability, and outlook on life and people has improved by leaps and bounds, and I don't have myself or Tang Center psychiatrists to thank.

Cloyne is not its history, Cloyne is not dangerous.

Cloyne is a huge house, with great people where opportunities are endless.
