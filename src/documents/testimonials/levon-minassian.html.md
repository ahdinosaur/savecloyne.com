Cloyne is a place to dwell, to live cooperatively, and to prompt you to know yourself.

Moving into Cloyne meant that I instantly befriended  from every part of academia from multiple different continents. I had found roommates willing to stay up all night discussing globalization,  a disposal of educational workshops in my living room, a soccer team with obnoxious supporters, and a place which was new every day that I was there. Merely walking into common space at night yields opportunities to engage with people eager to share something interesting. It was the only place I called home while I attended school at Berkeley and my education there would have been exceptionally stale in comparison if I did not have the academic environment that Cloyne provided. 

The house's beauty is in its fluidity and in its refusal to be pulled in any direction other than what the character its unique composition. During my two and half years living there I served as a Kitchen Manager, Board Rep,  and Food Manager. I gained invaluable insight about myself and cooperative living through ordering lots of yogurt, dancing with a mops during kitchen cleans, and sitting on ping pong tables until 3am in budget meetings. Most of the knowledge that prepared me for these positions was directly due to the way that information about house culture and opinion was passed down to me from the Clones that came before me.

The house is a Being of its own; it is a living entity. The history of all that has come before it is alive within the murals in its hallways, the stains in the dining room, the documents on the server, the garden and landscaping, and within the consciousness of the current membership passed down from the previous generation. To purge the current Clones who live with an insight and appreciation of the house and all of its functions would serve only to instill a new membership who will live in the shadow of an unjust expulsion and place the BSC as a whole at greater risk of incident. Instead, the BSC should cherish and empower the current Clones to continue addressing all future issues that the organization as a whole faces.
