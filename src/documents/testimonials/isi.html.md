There is no place in the world, I'm quite sure, like the Cloyne Court Hotel.

I came to Cloyne, like all Clones, in the unlikeliest of circumstances. There's no 'right' way to find yourself pulled into the coops, nor to establish oneself at a place like Cloyne. Still, looking back at my path, I can't help but laugh. I lived in a fraternity for my first two years at Cal. During my sophomore year, the woman who I was dating lived in Cloyne. I remember visiting her there for the first time and being horrified. The murals and graffiti on the walls; the carpet that felt like the green side of a sponge; the two people in kitchen scrubbing pots with nothing on their bodies but a gift-wrapping of saran-wrap. I was a fratboy, and my particular brand of uncleanliness and shenanigans suddenly seemed like something out of Happy Days or Gidget compared to Cloyne's proud, gilded anarchy.

I also probably got side-eyed for my cargo shorts and Abercrombie polo, if I'm being honest, which, while not totally undeserved, was enough to send me packing out of the front door and back into the warm, comfortable embrace of bi-weekly cleaners, catered dinners, and teasing pledges.

But if anything is capitol T, True, in this world, it's that people change. At first superficially (I went to a few music festivals; I experimented with drugs), and then deeply and meaningfully (I experimented with, and reexamined my sexuality; I allowed my personal politics to evolve and attenuate; I ate vegetarian and then stopped eating vegetarian; I left the country for 6 months). When I came back from Auckland I required something new and mysterious. I followed a dear friend into the abyss, the cantata of Cloyne Court.

And but, my God, what journey. On my first day at Cloyne, the day I moved in, I sat, naked, with a group of Old Clones, in a duct tape patchworked kids pool.

And I was comfortable. I mean, ok, not at first. But as a man who's always been a bit shy and reserved and, perhaps, defensive of his body's contours and protrusions, I sat in that pool, with people whom I had met just that day, and felt no judgement. I had not, since I was maybe four years old, felt like my nakedness was so accepted, so totally banal, that the idea of feeling self-conscious about my skin was made immediately absurd.

So I bought in. I lived in a triple on the ground floor. I made a home out of the chapel, with it's horrible, beautiful scribblings on the wall. I made donuts for special brunch. 

I found a space where no one was ever rejected. Sure, yes, there were cliques and groups, but they were always secondary to the purposeful purposelessness of the House. In this place, radical marxists made love with ardent Smithian economics majors. EECS students tended to basil plants with all the meticulous care of a Python algorithm. A brilliant mathematician tied glowsticks to his wall and shook sun from his hair. 

Cloyne taught me that it was perfectly fine to love whomever I was driven to love. That the depths of human creativity and compassion were surely without bottom. Cloyne helped me stop biting my nails, which, at the time, was no easy thing. Around election time, a group of anarchists and cynics gathered around and let me prattle to them about the electoral college, the path to 270, and the importance of down-ticket races. When President Obama was reelected, dozens of us sang and danced. When the moon was full, dozens of us, just the same, sang and danced.

There is nowhere in the world like Cloyne. Cloyne is love. Cloyne is suck.

Please, don't take it away from the young people who will need it in the future.
