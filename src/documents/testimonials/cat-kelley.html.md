I heard about Cloyne from a friend who said that the band Pangea played there. As someone who searches concert line-ups on a daily basis, I immediately researched this mysterious venue in my proximity. I was shocked to find that people lived there. 150 people. In a place with a musical legacy that stretches back to Elliot Smith, No Doubt, Green Day, and countless other bands. I knew I had to live there. 

I was initially apprehensive coming into Cloyne this past fall from a sheltered background. I would tell those unaffiliated with the co-ops that I was moving in, and their first reaction would be along the lines of, "Oh, that's gonna be so crazy!" 

But when I got here, I found a place vastly different from all the "crazy" stories. It was a place of political discourse, democratic council, artistic merit. Everyone contributed their share of work, put in their two cents, and took out of it a community. I saw how much effort people invested in the house, and that made me care about it too.

I recently had my faith in this community tested when I was physically assaulted by a non-resident. I had a solid support system of confidantes, but I didn't know if the community as a whole would support me in my attempt to PNG my assailant. Turns out, I was not only met with support from my fellow clones; I was given so much love and care that I neither asked for nor expected. In those moments, I realized that this is truly a community worth fighting for, and it would be a tragedy to lose it because outside perceptions reduce us to a mere "drug culture."

We are not a drug culture. We are a culture of celebration, acceptance, creativity, democracy, and yes, even academia. 

I came a stranger, and I stayed a friend.
