I lived in Cloyne for the entirety of my tenure at UC Berkeley. I graduated in the Fall of 2013 Magna Cum Laude, and I was the Student Speaker at my commencement ceremony. I founded several student organizations, and I was an outspoken advocate for LGBT rights throughout campus. Cloyne allowed me to even throw an LGBT event for my student organization as shown in the picture attached. I have never used any substance that could kill me. I never encouraged any of my peers to engage in dangerous activity. I am an LGBT person of color who now works as a Financial Analyst at a prestigious public company, reporting directly to the CFO.

Cloyne helped me get to where I am today. Cloyne has a solid network of students that are academically oriented and driven for success. If you vote for your proposed measures, you are denying students from a background like myself from achieving their potential. The students at Berkeley who are most successful in their academic endeavors achieve success because of solid social networks and an excellent work life balance. Cloyne provides an atmosphere of acceptance and tolerance. Being LGBT isn't easy, even at UC Berkeley as shown in recent student suicides. Cloyne is notorious for having many LGBT residents in addition to an entire house open to all forms of sexual orientation. Please do not deny future students the same opportunities this house provided.
