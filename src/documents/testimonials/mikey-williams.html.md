Cloyne is where I found who I am.

When I started my relationship with Cloyne by boarding Spring 2012, I found the place a bit overwhelming, yet fascinating and full of wonder. I was willing to give it a chance, so I moved in with my roommate and contributed the skills I had by becoming Network Manager. At the time, the network was in shambles: the current router had just died, our internet connection spotty at best, and the network topology a mess. We worked through it, and I haven't stopped yet.

Cloyne has provided me with the resources to work on my passion, technology, with the support and feedback of a large peer community. I've been able to root my heart into my work knowing that what I am doing has a lasting impact. By doing this work, I came to an important realization: I didn't need further schooling to push me forward, I only needed a strong will to work and a community who will support my work in exchange for mutual benefit. So I dropped out of school, and sadly ended my living stay at Cloyne in Summer 2013.

However, I will never be able to leave Cloyne in spirit, as my passion continues and Cloyne is still what I consider home. I continue to be Network Manager (for now) and am using what I have learned at Cloyne and in my time away from school to hopefully start a workers' cooperative that provides tech infrastructure to cooperatives. I love Cloyne and the culture that I have been a part of is the reason that my life is now dedicated towards open source technology for cooperatives. I am only one of many who found themselves here. To kill the current Cloyne culture is to inflict unnecessary harm on a beautiful creature while ignoring the actual issue: substance abuse and mental illness. Together we must save not only Cloyne but the whole BSC.
