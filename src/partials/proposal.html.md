### Lawsuit settlement

- The 2010 lawsuit regarding an overdose at Cloyne (John Gibson) was recently settled out of court by our insurance providers
- This represents two main things
  - That Cloyne has a perceived drug culture
  - That this liability is public
- What does this mean to the BSC?
  - We are at risk of unaffordably high insurance rates or of being uninsurable
    - Uninsurable = we close / shut down
  - We need to make a direct response to this settlement to show our efforts to prevent further incidences and liability

A change needs to happen now. In similar situations in BSC history (e.g. Barrington, Le Chateau), the Board acted too slowly to prevent serious reprecussions, including:
  - Drastic rates increases, up to 25% in two years
  - Difficulty securing insurance and high insurance premiums

### Outline of the plan

Cabinet - the executive committee of the Board comprised of the President, 6 VPs, and 2 at-large members - is proposing to the Board a response plan to the settlement:

1. Substance-free
  - No alcohol or drugs on the property
  - A direct response to the liability of drug culture
2. Academic Theme House
  - Host annual BSC academic lecture
  - Added study rooms & extensive quiet hours
  - No out-of-house parties
3. Open admittance
  - No entry requirement, but must sign agreement of house rules
4. Closed for renovations Summer '14
  - More study rooms and new furniture
  - Reduce occupancy to ~140
5. New Cloyne membership to populate
  - Necessary to create a new space & new culture
6. House-determined rules

Board will discuss this proposal Thursday Feb. 27, 7pm at Rochdale.

Board will **vote** March 13th, 7pm at Rochdale.
