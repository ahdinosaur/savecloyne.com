## Initial Statement by Cloyne House Manager (Mirit Friedman)

Recently the membership of Cloyne Court was "briefed" with a proposal by the Cabinet of the BSC to: 1) Make Cloyne a substance free house, 2) Make Cloyne an academic themed house and 3) Kick out all current membership and not allow them to return.

The current membership of Cloyne is in the process of discussing said proposal and working on an alternative proposal with the community that would satisfy the Board of Directors as well as the current membership to ensure a successful and prosperous future for the BSC as a whole as well as Cloyne specifically. We (Cloyne) feel that the current proposal on the table inadequately, unfairly, and uncooperatively addresses the situation that the BSC is trying to remedy.

Moving forward Cloyne is seriously considering all of our options and we welcome any comments and feedback. Please ask your questions before making any assumptions or blanket statements as to what the future holds for Cloyne seeing as this is the beautiful home of 150 students, members, and above all, people.
